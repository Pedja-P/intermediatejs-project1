# Udacity - Object Oriented Javascript

## Description

Generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, display the name of the human rather than species and no fact is necessary for the human. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed should be random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts (3 should be from the created methods). One of the titles should be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, "All birds are considered dinosaurs."

### Project Goal

This project is a real-world scenario of working with object-oriented javascript. The functionality serves two purposes: to improve experience building objects with javascript as well as taking advantage of user interaction with the DOM. ES6 classes are used as their syntax is cleaner and more concise.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

    ```git clone git@github.com:Pedja-P/intermediatejs-project1.git```
